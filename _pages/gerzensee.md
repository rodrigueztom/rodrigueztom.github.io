I took part in the [Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics](https://szgerzensee.ch/courses/bdp) in 2022/23.
These are all the solutions to old exams that I could write.
Your professors might be different nowadays, but you might still profit from these solutions.
Feel free to distribute them to other students that might find them helpful.

All solutions are hand written and some are not that readable.
In addition, the newer exams are not listed, as I did not see them when I took the courses.
Therefore, I created a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rodrigueztom/Gerzensee_Exams) to
(1) translate the handwritten copies into LaTex
(2) let you contribute with newer solutions.
If you find some time to contribute, it would be greatly appreciated by all future students of the program.

**Disclaimer:
I do not know if the solutions are correct, so you might find mistakes.
All the solutions were produced by me and are not validated by the Study Center Gerzensee in any way.**
