# How to print shit at Uni FR

:warning: **You must be at Uni, or connected to the VPN**

1. Go to the [vprint](http://vprint.unifr.ch) website
2. Login with your credentials
3. Go to `Web Print`
4. Klick on `Submit a Job`
5. Choose your options (e.g. black and white, A4).

:warning: **If you want to use the small printer**: Choose `svw-papercut\MONO-UNIFR (virtual)`

6. Copies, and account. Use account number `661008`
7. Upload the document from your PC
8. Go to `Jobs Pending Release`, and either release all, or klick on print for individual jobs 
9. Choose the printer you need. The small one is called `svw-print-02\sespr044338`, but not sure if it is free if you did not select `svw-papercut\MONO-UNIFR (virtual)` before. The large printer on our floor is `svw-print-02\ccpr231`
10. Pick up your copies
